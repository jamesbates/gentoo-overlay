==============================

This Gentoo overlay contains ebuild scripts for some useful Astronomy programs, including:

- phd2
- indistarter
- eqmodgui
- ccdciel
- skychart

How to use it
-------------
On a runnig Gentoo system, install eselect-repository:

  emerge eselect-repository

Now you can add this repository:

  eselect add jamesbates git https://github.com/jamesbates/gentoo-overlay.git
  emerge sync

You can now add/update/remove the programs of your choice, as you would any other Gentoo programs, e.g.:

  emerge phd2 ccdciel eqmodgui

The ebuilds are all keyworded as experimental (i.e. ~amd64), so you'll likely have to add them to your
/etc/portage/package.keywords

In order to use many of the 3rd party INDI drivers (e.g. eqmod, which is required dependency of eqmod-gui), you may wich to add the 
"hamari" overlay:

  eselect repository enable hamari

, and then enable the desired drivers in your make.conf:

  INDILIB_DRIVERS="asicam toupbase eqmod gphoto"
