James Bates' astronomy overlay
==============================

This Gentoo overlay contains ebuild scripts for some useful Astronomy programs, including:

- phd2
- indistarter
- eqmodgui
- ccdciel
- skychart

It also contains the 3rd party INDI drivers from https://github.com/indilib/indi-3rdparty.
This includes drivers such as:

- indi_asi_ccd
- indi_gphoto_ccd
- indi_eqmod_telescope

How to use it
-------------
On a runnig Gentoo system, install layman:

  emerge layman

Next, copy the file jamesbates.xml in the repository to your /etc/layman/overlays directory:

  mkdir -p /etc/layman/overlays
  curl -o /etc/layman/overlays/jamesbates.xml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesbates/gentoo-overlay/master/jamesbates.xml

Finally, apply the overlay using layman

  layman -a jamesbates

You can now add/update/remove the programs of your choice, as you would any other Gentoo programs, e.g.:

  emerge phd2 ccdciel eqmodgui

The ebuilds are all keyworded as experimental (i.e. ~amd64), so you'll likely have to add them to your
/etc/portage/package.keywords

By default, all 3rd party drivers available are installed when you emerge sci-libs/indilib-3rdparty. You can limit
the drivers you want by defining the variable INDI_DRIVERS in your /etc/portage/make.conf. For example:

INDI_DRIVERS="asicam toupbase eqmod gphoto"
